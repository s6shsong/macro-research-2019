Q1, EU emissions have fallen by 22% from 1990 to 2017, Sweden 
GHG emission decreased 26% from 1990 to 2017, why do you say Sweden is a great success for carbon reform since 26% is not much higher than 22%. 
A: finding more "shocking" data about Sweden's carbon reform achievements.
Hint1: finding GHG data from  east european countries which normally have high GHG emission, so that Sweden and these countries can be compared to Sweden's success.
Hint2: finding graph showing GHG reductions from all main european countries.
Q2: why not putting "current situation in Germany" in front of "Sweden's success"?
Q3: Population growth formular, what if survive probability equals 0?
Q4: who supplies carbon-emitting energy?
A: no supplier exists, only demand side, no supply side.
Q5, Equilibrium part, Pe+Tauc should be corrected into Pe.
Q6, goveronment budget balance and third equation in markets clear
Q7, Life span and age of retirement should be corrected to model age
Q8, new labor tax rate should be calculated "inside the model". Weight of energy on consumption is 7%, but we assume weight of energy on total output is 5%, which is very conflicting.
Q9, in the preliminary result the capital K has increased too much, 30% which is abnormal.
